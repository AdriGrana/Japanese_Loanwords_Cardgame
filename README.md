# Japanese Loanwords Flashcards Game

## About

This project is a game designed to enhance Japanese vocabulary by practicing the explanation of loanwords (外来語) in Japanese without using any loanwords in the explanation. It is based on a physical card system where:

1. The teacher draws a random number card and shows it to the student (without seeing it themselves).
2. The student must explain the corresponding word from a set of six displayed words in Japanese, avoiding the use of any loanwords.

The game includes over **2,500 unique loanwords**, carefully selected from the JMdict dictionary using the "gai" tag, which identifies common loanwords.

## Features

- **Interactive Flashcards**: Display six random loanwords for each round.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile use.
- **Random Word Selection**: Randomizes the words for each session.
- **Enlarged Flashcard View**: Allows better focus on individual words when needed.
- **Reveal Button**: Displays English translations for all six words.
- **New Words Button**: Generates a fresh set of six words.

## How to Play

1. The teacher draws a physical number card (1-6) and shows it to the student.
